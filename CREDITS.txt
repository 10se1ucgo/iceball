This was out of date. I'm going to try and collate all the names.
If your name is missing, please prod us (even if we don't use your contribution anymore)
and we'll chuck it in.

Lead Developer + the guy who started the project out of frustration:
	GreaseMonkey

And the rest in alphabetical order, without whom this project would not have been possible to run without a degree and a supercomputer:
	10se1ucgo
	Articsledder
	BR
	Bully
	Dany0
	learn_more
	melchips
	rakiru
	Sonarpulse
	topo
	Triplefox

Special thanks to:
	BR, for your countless contributions to the code and whatnot.
	melchips, for your seriously awesome work on the OpenGL renderer.
	rakiru, for hosting the server from day 42 (as well as some other cool things too).
	Triplefox, for your GUI system I *still* have yet to learn how to use,
		and the many other contributions you did earlier on.
