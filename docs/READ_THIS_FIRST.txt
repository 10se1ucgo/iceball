### INCOMPLETE. Hopefully will apply eventually. ###

Congratulations for successfully extracting Iceball from its archive!
I'm assuming you did that, right?
If you're running it from within the archive, extract the damn thing NOW.
It won't work, otherwise.

Anyhow, if this manual isn't clear enough, please inform us somehow!

PROGRAMMERS, TAKE NOTE: Please don't make server launchers.

I want there to be a minimum barrier to entry which requires that people read
this text file here which you are reading right now.

While on the topic of stuff to not make...
If you have a hack for this game, PLEASE DON'T RELEASE IT.

Releasing hacks means that people a shitload dumber than yourself are using the
stuff you made, and they'll say "thank you" once, then immediately forget about
you and say "i'm so awesome and my penis is huge" many, many more times.

A good deterrent is to look at mpgh.net, and watching all the all-lower-case
zero-punctuation posts which have been repeated countless times throughout the
whole forums. Just look at a thread and you can feel your IQ being sapped out
of you. Yes, MPGH really is bad enough to lower your IQ just by READING it.

Now, the first thing you will need to know is how to use the commandline.
If you don't know THAT, here's a quick guide:

Stuff on the commandline takes the form:
  command argument argument "argument with spaces in it" argument
If the command you're running has no arguments,
you can run it like so:
On MS-DOS systems, like Windows:
  cls
On UNIX based systems, like Linux:
  clear

Basically, the only built-in command you'll need is "cd".
Let's say you were dropped into where you extracted Iceball to on startup,
and you want to go to the pkg/base/pmf folder,
you would do this:
MS-DOS:
  cd pkg\base\pmf
UNIX:
  cd pkg/base/pmf

If for some reason you extracted Iceball to C:\Program Files\Iceball,
and you got dropped into some random location on, say, the D: drive,
you would do this:
  c:
  cd "\Program Files\Iceball"

I'm assuming people using UNIX based systems can work out how it works on
their system. (Also, typing some of something then pressing TAB helps, too,
at least for those of you who are using bash as your shell.)

If you would like to know more about how to use the command line,
use a search engine.

UNIX users: "man" is a great program. Try "man ls", for instance.
Note, for shell builtins, you might want to try e.g. "help cd".

Anyhow, with that sorted, and assuming you're in the Iceball directory now,
type this into the commandline for help:
MS-DOS:
  iceball
UNIX:
  ./iceball

You should be fine from there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iceball refers to one of two things:
- The game engine.
- The game itself, currently located in pkg/base.
