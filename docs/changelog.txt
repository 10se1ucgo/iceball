Interestingly enough this has never ever been used.

Oh well, if someone wants to fill this in, that'd be awesome.
Otherwise, try "git log".

0.1.0/0.0 - Released YYYY-MM-DD.
- Initial release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version scheme:
Engine: w.x.ya
Engine (git): w.x.ya-z
Game:   w.x.ya/p.qb-r

w.x = major base engine version. Note, 0.10 is > 0.9.
y = minor base engine version, for bugfixes and whatnot. optional.
a = subminor base engine version, for last-minute fixes. optional.
z = git version. optional, must be 0 for releases and >=1 for nonreleases!

p.qb-r = same as above but for game code (p is equivalent to w.x).
p.q is mandatory; b is optional.
These start at 0.0.

Note, if you increase one of these, you reset those after it to zero
(or blank for "a"/"b").

"a"/"b" should never go past the letter z.
But if it does, you might as well just bump "y"/"q" up a digit,
and reset "a"/"b" to blank.

Ultimately:
- servers must always have the latest w.x.ya release version of the engine
- clients must always have the latest w.x release version
- clients ideally should have the latest w.x.ya release version
- servers ideally should have the latest w.x.ya/p.qb version of the game component
- clients do not need the game component at all
