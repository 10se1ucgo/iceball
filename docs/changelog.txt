0.1.0.0 - Released YYYY-MM-DD.
- Initial release.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version scheme:
w.x.y.za
w.x = major base engine version. Note, 0.10 is > 0.9.
y = minor base engine version, for quick fixes.
z = major game version.
a = minor game version (a lowercase letter), for quick fixes.

Note, if you increase one of these, you reset those after it to zero
(or blank for "a").

"a" should never go past the letter z.
But if it does, you might as well just bump "z" up a digit,
and reset "a" to blank.

Ultimately:
- servers should always have the latest w.x.y.za version, and
- clients and servers alike must always have the latest w.x version.
