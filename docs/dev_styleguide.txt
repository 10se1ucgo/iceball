Style guide for developers:

HARD TABS EVERYWHERE.
Do not rely on tab width, other than "it won't be any more than 8".
If you need to do ASCII art or whatnot, THEN you use spaces.

C:
- Braces start on a new line, except for:
	- else if
	- else
	- optionally, array/struct data (but NOT the structs themselves).
- Braces are by no means required.

Lua:
- All pretty loose really.
