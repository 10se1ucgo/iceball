Map editing guide

Use pkg/iceball/mapedit.

Arguments should be one of the following:

iceball -s 0 pkg/iceball/mapedit pkg/maps/inmap.icemap clsave/vol/outmap.icemap
iceball -s 0 pkg/iceball/mapedit 512 64 512 clsave/vol/outmap.icemap

You can optionally not specify that last filename,
but it is not a recommended practice.

For the first format, it is totally OK if the first two filenames are the same.

It is recommended that your maps are AT LEAST 128x(whatever)x128.


Default keys:

WASD = move around
SPACE/LCTRL = move up/down

left click = break
right click = build

F10 = quicksave map

F5 = release mouse
ESC = quit
