Map editing guide

Use pkg/iceball/mapedit.

Arguments should be one of the following:

iceball -s 0 pkg/iceball/mapedit pkg/maps/inmap.icemap clsave/vol/outmap.icemap
iceball -s 0 pkg/iceball/mapedit 512 64 512 clsave/vol/outmap.icemap

You can optionally not specify that last filename,
but it is not a recommended practice.

For the first format, it is totally OK if the first two filenames are the same.

It is recommended that your maps are AT LEAST 128x(whatever)x128.

Default keys:

WASD = move around
SPACE/LCTRL = move up/down

LSHIFT = high speed movement
V = low speed movement

mouse depends on tool used:
	"Minecraft" tool (press 1):
		L = break
		R = build
		M = pick
	"Select" tool (press 2):
		L = corner 1
		R = corner 2
	"Paint" tool (press 3):
		R = paint
		M = pick

INS = fill selection
DEL = clear selection
P = paint selection
LALT+S = stack in direction + move selection
LALT+A = stack in direction + move selection (don't replace anything with air)

TAB = colour picker

F10 = quicksave map

F5 = release mouse
ESC = quit
