Icemap - MapEnts
================

The MapEnts chunk stores data relating to entities on the map. Entities include
things like spawn points, pickup locations, prancing llama locations and 
preferred dance move, etc.

The data is stored as a JSON list, like so:

	[
		{
			"class": "entitiy type",
			"class_specific_key": "arbitrary data"
		},
		... additional entities
	]

The `class` attribute must be in every entry, and defines the type of entity.
All other fields are arbitrary and are set/used in any way by anything.
However, here are some suggested standards to follow:
 * Keys should be lowercase
 * Words in keys should be separated by underscores
 * Vectors should be specified as lists of numbers

Entity Types
-------------

Any game, mod or tool can create arbitrary entities, but the "official"/known
ones are documented below:

### spawn

Spawn area:

	{
		"class": "spawn",
		"team": 0,
		"pos_min": [0, 0, 128],
		"pos_max": [128, 63, 384]
	}

Specific spawn point:

	{
		"class": "spawn",
		"team": 0,
		"pos": [0, 0, 128]
	}
