pretty simple really

start with the header of "PMF",0x1A,1,0,0,0

then there's a whole bunch of this:

uint16_t radius;
int16_t x,y,z;
uint8_t b,g,r,reserved;

rinse, lather, repeat
until you hit a radius of 0
that's when you *stop*

units are 8:8 fixed point in terms of the vxl grid by default

"reserved" needs to be 0 or else you suck
NO SIDECHANNELING YOUR NAME IN THERE
i'm going to enforce this in the renderer
and will outright reject files which don't have 0 in ALL of these slots
