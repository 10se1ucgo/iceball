Basic goals:
    1. Layout compiler
        Three stages of support:
            Absolute positioning and alignment
            Relative positioning and alignment
            Packing + reflow
        Packing is considerably more complex than the first two but has huge benefits.
        Compilation on existing widgets should be allowed, and parameters should be adjustable via funcpointers
            (so that tweening is possible)
    2. Event model
        Click (down+up)
        Slide (down-hold-up)
        Raw down, raw up
        Rectangle collision detection
    3. Widgets
        Button
        Modal button
        Label text
        Paragraph text
        Markdown(or similar) text
        Slider
        Checkbox
        Frame + clipping
        Color picker
