work in progress

libraries are "client" and "server"
stuff in both is also put in "common"
note, behaviour might be subtly different

all files must use "/" as a path separator (Unix Master Race)
valid characters are listed here (ignoring the path separator):
-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
anything else is invalid and will just be outright rejected

furthermore, no paths will be accepted where a . follows a /
this means that hidden files on unixlikes will not be accepted!

files that are meant to be intercepted should be prefixed with a *
e.g. "*thismap"

maximum path length is 128

stuff that's actually implemented will be marked with an @

lua base library stuff:
	math.* @
	string.* @
	pcall @
	error @
	print @
	loadstring @
	loadfile @ (TODO: filter the path)
	dofile @ (TODO: filter the path)
	_G @
	
	nothing else yet
	
	check http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ for more info on these
	
	some notes:
	- dofile(x) = loadfile(x)()
	- loadfile(x) = common.fetch_block("lua", x)
	- common.fetch_block(ftype, x) =
	    if not common.fetch_start(ftype, x) then return nil end
	    co
	- just about every "load" function is based on common.fetch_block
	  (TODO: make this true!)

common.base_dir @
	current base directory (minus the "pkg/" bit)
	
	writing to this string will *not* change the base dir,
	so *don't write to it* or else you'll just screw up your own code!

client/server.hook_tick = fn(sec_curtime, sec_delta)->sec_wait @
	sets a hook called every "tick"
	returns a number telling it how long it wants to wait for
	
	"sec_curtime" is the current time elapsed from the start
	"sec_delta" is the time elapsed from the start of the last
	call to the hooked function
	
	setting this to nil will quit your game
	
	NOTE: DO NOT USE COMMON FOR THIS HOOK!
	(only client/server is accepted)

client/server.hook_file = fn(ftype, fname, clisock)->object
	sets a hook to intercept networked file requests
	
	"clisock" is the socket pertaining to the file request
	
	can return nil to cancel the request
	can return true to perform the default request
	
	NOTE: DO NOT USE COMMON FOR THIS HOOK!
	(only client/server is accepted)

client.hook_render = fn() @
	sets a hook called every frame
	
	this is the only place where it is safe to render stuff
	such as models and HUDs and whatnot

client.hook_key = fn(key, state, modif) @
	sets a hook called every time a key changes
	
	state is either true or false

client.hook_mouse_button = fn(button, state) @
	sets a hook called every time a mouse button changes
	
	state is either true or false

client.hook_mouse_motion = fn(x, y, dx, dy) @
	sets a hook called every time the mouse is moved
	
	x, y are the current position
	dx, dy are the delta positions
	
	you will probably use the latter pair if the mouse is "locked"
	as x, y are not defined the same on all platforms!

client.mouse_lock_set(state) @
	locks / unlocks the mouse depending on "state"

client.mouse_visible_set(state) @
	shows / hides the mouse depending on "state"

success = common.fetch_start(ftype, fname)
	initiates a file fetch
	
	"ftype" is one of the following:
	- "lua": lua script
	- "map": map (autodetect)
	- "icemap": map (icemap) - in-memory maps are serialised as THIS.
	- "vxl": map (vxl) - CANNOT SAVE IN THIS FORMAT.
	- "pmf": pmf model
	- "tga": tga image
	- "json": json data (TODO)
	- "log": log data (TODO)
	- "wav": wav sound (TODO)
	
	for the server, this just loads the file from the disk.
	
	for the client, all clsave/* stuff is taken from the disk,
	but all other files are downloaded from the server.
	
	returns true if the fetch has started,
	or false if there is something already in the queue.

obj, csize, usize, ftype, fname, amount = common.fetch_poll()
	polls the 
	"obj" is one of the following:
	- "nil" if transfer aborted or nothing is being fetched
	  - in this case, all other fields will be nil
	- "false" if still downloading
	- the object you requested
	  - in this case, another poll will just return nils
	
	"amount" is in the range 0 <= "amount" <= 1,
	and indicates how much is downloaded
	"csize" is the compressed size of the file
	"usize" is the uncompressed size
	"ftype" is the type of the file being fetched:
	- "lua": lua script
	- "map": map
	- "pmf": pmf model
	- "tga": tga image
	- "json": json data (TODO)
	- "log": log data (TODO)
	- "wav": wav sound (TODO)
	"fname" is the name of the file being fetched
	
	note, all vxl maps will be converted to icemap before sending.
	

obj = common.fetch_block(ftype, fname) @
	fetches a file using common.fetch_*
	
	simply returns "nil" on error
	
	if there is already something being fetched,
	it will return "nil", too

map = common.map_load(fname, fmt = "auto") @
	loads a map, either "vxl" or "icemap"
	use "auto" to autodetect
	
	this will return nil if it fails.

map = common.map_new(lx, ly, lz) @
	creates a new map
	
	note, ly is the *height* of the new map
	
	also all dimensions must be powers of two,
	otherwise this will fail horribly!
	
	this will throw a lua error if it fails.

common.map_free(map) @
	free the given map
	if you don't do this then it's memoryleaktopia
	(plus i'm allowed to kill you)
	
	ALSO DON'T DO THIS TO THE CURRENT "SET" MAP
	
	TODO: clean up all models on game kill

common.map_set(map) @
	sets the "current" map to "map"
	note, "map" can be nil to disable rendering anything

common.map_save(map, fname, fmt = "icemap") @
	saves a map to a file, either "vxl" or "icemap"
	
	this will throw a lua error if it fails.

r, g, b, dist = client.map_fog_get() @
	gets the current fog colour / distance

client.map_fog_set(r, g, b, dist) @
	sets the current fog colour / distance

lx, ly, lz = common.map_get_dims() @
	gets the map's dimensions
	
	these will be nil if there is no map loaded

table = common.map_pillar_get(px, pz) @
	returns a full pillar of data, skipping the total size header
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!

common.map_pillar_set(px, pz, table) @
	sets a full pillar of data
	
	this will be nil if there is no map loaded
	
	the data is checked before setting,
	and will throw a lua error if it fails.
	
	note, the data wraps around here (wrt px,pz)!
	
	WARNING: You MUST update the side pillars in your code!
	You MUST ALSO fill in the newly-exposed blocks,
	as well as remove the newly-unexposed blocks!
	Otherwise, there WILL be gaps!
	
	WE'RE NOT DOING IT FOR YOU!

client.camera_point(dx, dy, dz, zoom = 1.0, roll = 0.0) @
	points the camera in a direction with zoom factor "zoom"
	and roll "roll" (in radians, sorry)

pmf = common.model_new(bonemax = 5) @
	creates a new model
	remember to free it when you're done
	as this is only a light userdata

	useful if you know exactly how many you'll need
	
	currently the number of bones is limited to 256

pmf = common.model_load_pmf(fname) @
	loads a pmf from a file
	remember to free it when you're done

	"ptmax" is the initial maximum number of "points"
	this bone can have initially
	useful if you know exactly how many you'll need
	
	currently the number of points is limited to 4096
	
	WARNING: YOU *MUST* TAKE THE pmf VALUE RETURNED
	AND *NOT* USE THE OLD ONE ANY LONGER!
	
	this is because realloc() is called on this dynamic list
	and it can seriously crash badly
	
	JUST SAYING

common.model_bone_free(pmf, boneidx) @
	removes a bone from the model

name, table = common.model_bone_get(pmf, boneidx) @
	gets a table with every point in the given bone
	
	each entry in the table has the following keys:
		uint16_t radius; // fixed point 8.8
		int16_t x,y,z; // fixed point 8.8
		uint8_t r,g,b;
	
	the reserved field of each point is inaccessible from this API

common.model_bone_set(pmf, boneidx, name, table) @
	replaces the bone's contents with that in the table
	
	note, bones will be rejected if:
	- name is > 15 chars long
	- radius,x,y,z,r,g,b are missing
	- 0 <= radius < 65536 fails
	- -32768 <= x,y,z < 32768 fails

	gets the dimensions of the screen

img, width, height = common.img_load(fname) @

client.img_blit(img, dx, dy, width = iwidth, height = iheight, sx = 0, sy = 0, color = 0xFFFFFFFF) @

	"color" indicates a base 0xAARRGGBB colour to use
	
	this is clipped to fit!

tab = common.json_parse(str)
	parses the JSON string "str"
	
	yes, this parser is anal-retentive,

	it also errors if it encounters a char 0 in the middle of a string.
	
	returns nil on error

tab = common.json_load(fname)
	loads a JSON file and parses it
	
	returns nil on error

str = common.json_pack(tab)

	the following types are supported:
	- numbers
	- strings
	- true, false, nil
	- tables with only string keys
	- tables with only numeric keys from 1 through #
	
	and therefore the following types are NOT supported:
	- functions/closures of ANY sort (C or Lua)
	- tables with mixed hash/numeric keys
	- userdata (light or otherwise)
	
	and i think that's about it for types really

common.json_save(fname, tab)
