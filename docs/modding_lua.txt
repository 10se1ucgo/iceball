work in progress

libraries are "client" and "server"
stuff in both is also put in "common"
note, behaviour might be subtly different

all scripts must use "/" as a path separator (Unix Master Race)
valid characters are listed here (ignoring the path separator):
-.0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[]_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
anything else is invalid and will just be outright rejected

stuff that's actually implemented will be marked with an @

lua base library stuff:
	math.*
	string.*
	pcall
	error
	
	nothing else yet
	
	check http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/ for more info on these

time_delta = common.tick(sec = 0.0)
	forces a sleep for "sec" seconds (floating point),
	then tells you how much time actually elapsed

success = server.stream_new_map(fname, fmt = "auto")
	loads a map, either .vxl or some format we might invent
	which will probably be .vxl with our own header
	+ changed meaning for the 4th colour byte
	
	this will also send the map to the other clients

success = server.create_new_map(lx, ly, lz)
	creates a new map
	
	note, ly is the *height* of the new map

success = common.save_map(fname, fmt = "bsm")
	saves a map to a file

client.camera_point(dx, dy, dz, zoom = 1.0, pitch = 0.0)
	points the camera in a direction with zoom factor "zoom"
	and pitch "pitch" (in radians, sorry)

client.camera_move_local(dx, dy, dz)
	moves the camera in the camera-local direction (dx,dy,dz)

client.camera_move_global(dx, dy, dz)
	moves the camera in the world direction (dx,dy,dz)

client.camera_move_to(px, py, pz)
	moves the camera to the world position (px,py,pz)
