Heartbeat server protocol

Main heartbeat server:
	play.iceballga.me port 27790
	(port is for UDP *and* TCP)

Iceball clients should connect to:
	play.iceballga.me port 27795
	[ NOT IMPLEMENTED ]

Iceball only supports IPv4 UDP ports at the time of writing, sorry.

Feel free to host your own heartbeat server, though!

Note, S = heartbeat server, C = heartbeat client (AKA iceball server).

The heartbeat server will terminate your session after 120 seconds of inactivity.

ALL PROTOCOLS ARE LITTLE ENDIAN WHERE APPROPRIATE, GUYS!

Iceball servers interface the heartbeat server using this UDP protocol...

"1CEB" hbversion.u16 ibversion.u32 port.u16 players_current.u16 players_max.u16 name.z[30] mode.z[10] map.z[30]
	I->H
	Announce a server.

	Note, remember to send a burst of 5 of these
	with a second in between each packet,
	and do this every 40 seconds

	(that is, a gap of 36 seconds between the last of a burst
	and the first of the next).

	Note, the strings are terminated with a NUL (char 0)
	unless they hit their string limit,
	in which case there is no NUL. BE WARY OF THIS.

"MSOK" cookie[]
	H->I

	Your packet was accepted.

	If your server gets this message, send a "HSHK" with the same cookie you received.

	cookie can be any length.

"HSHK" cookie[]
	I->H

	Handshake.

	Only once the heartbeat server receives this will your server be listed.

"BADV" hbversion.u16 ibversion.u32
	H->I

	Your version of Iceball and/or the heartbeat protocol are too old and/or new.
	Here's the version we expect.

	If your server gets this message, give up.

	Alternatively, if you support the given heartbeat version, try falling back to it.

"BADF"
	H->I

	The packet you sent was complete horseshit and you should feel bad for writing such bad code.

	If your server gets this message, crash in shame, because your code is seriously broken.
	Or alternatively just don't send any more data to the server.

	But crashing with an error is a much better idea.

OK, so that's the UDP side of the master server.

The TCP side is a minimal HTTP server at the same port with these interfaces:

/:
/index.html:
	An HTML page following a template.
/style.css:
	A stylesheet you can provide.
	[ NOT IMPLEMENTED ]
/master.json:
	The raw serverlist info in JSON format.
	Here's the expected format!

	{
		"version": int,
		"servers": [
			{
				"address": str,
				"port": int,
				"players_current": int,
				"players_max": int,
				"name": str,
				"mode": str,
				"map": str,
				"version": str
			}
		]
	}
