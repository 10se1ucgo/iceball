Notes:
	"FATAL ERROR" means "terminate the damn connection".

Base encapsulation:
	0x10 salt[32] version.u32 namelen name[namelen] 0x00:
		C->S Authentication with server
		"salt" is agreed on from some sort of master server
		Currently ignored and should all be 0x00
		"name" is also ignored at the moment
		"version" is the current protocol version
		
		current: 0x00000001
		
		TODO: add some sort of auth method
	0x11:
		S->C Authentication acknowledgement
	0x17 msglen msg[msglen] 0x00:
		C->S Quit / S->C Kick
		
		Connection MUST be terminated
		after sending/receiving this message
	
	0x30 flags namelen name[namelen] 0x00:
		Request file to be transferred
		"name" is the filename
		"flags" has these bits:
			bits 0-2:
				000 = * RESERVED *
				001 = JSON data [ NOT SUPPORTED YET ]
				010 = lua script
				011 = icemap data
				100 = pmf model
				101 = tga image
				110 = CSV log data [ NOT SUPPORTED YET ]
				111 = * RESERVED *
	0x31 flags clen.u32 ulen.u32 namelen name[namelen] 0x00:
		Start file transfer
		"name" is the filename
		"flags" has these bits:
			bits 0-2:
				000 = * RESERVED *
				001 = JSON data [ NOT SUPPORTED YET ]
				010 = lua script

		"clen" is the compressed length
		"ulen" is the uncompressed length
		
		"name" CAN be blank, and probably should be if it's a map
		
		All files are compressed as zlib streams
	0x32:
		Cleanly end file transfer
	0x33: offset.u32 len.u16 data[len]
		Send a block of data
		Maximum length of len is 1024
		If offset+len > clen, FATAL ERROR
	0x34:
		Abort incoming file transfer
	0x35:
		Abort outgoing file transfer
	
	0x40..0x7E data[this-0x3F]:
		Lua packet of length (this-0x3F)
	0x7F length.u16 data[length]:
		Lua packet of length "length"
		Minimum length of a packet is 1
		Maximum length of a packet is 1280

	Notes:
	- pid is from the range 1 to 250.
	
	0x01 time.u16:
		ping with lower 16 bits of current time in msecs
	0x02 time.u16:
		pong with lower 16 bits of current time in msecs
		
		if the connection exceeds 10 seconds of lag, kill it
		
		if the gap between the server and client time
		extends by 10 seconds, client is probably using CE speedhack
	
	0x03 pid x.fs y.fs z.fs:
		player set position
		
		note, for C->S pid MUST be 0x00
	
	0x04 pid ya.u8 xa.u8:
		player set orientation
		
		angles are as defined:
		for ya, -128->128 is full circle
		for xa, -128->128 is half circle
		
		note, for C->S pid MUST be 0x00
	
	0x05 pid team weapon namelen name[namelen] score.s16 kills.s16 deaths.s16: (S->C)
		adds player to server
		
		note, this can be used to update a player on the server
	
	0x06 pid: (S->C)
		sets client player id to "pid"
	
	0x07 pid: (S->C)
		removes player from server
	
	0x08 x.u16 y.u16 z.u16 b g r typ:
		place a block
	
	0x09 x.u16 y.u16 z.u16:
		destroy a block
	
	0x0A x.u16 y.u16 z.u16:
		destroy a 3 high pillar
	
	0x0B x.u16 y.u16 z.u16:
		collapse a section of blocks
		
		NOTE: will be IGNORED if the floodfill hits the bottom!
	
	0x0C pid x.fs y.fs z.fs ya.u8 xa.u8: (S->C)
		player spawn
