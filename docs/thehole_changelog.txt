Iceball-MK Revision 11:
- Fixed execv when executed from somewhere other than the .exe directory.

Iceball-MK Revision 10:
- Fixed model_bone_free.

Iceball-MK Revision 9:
- Fixed dedi build which was broken in Rev 8
  - There is a version of this in the repo which says Rev 8 due to yet another oversight. There's really only one version though.

Iceball-MK Revision 8:
- Fixed a bunch of crashes and generally crap memory handling

Iceball-MK Revision 7:
- Improved frustum culling
- Made occlusion culling actually work

Iceball-MK Revision 6:
- Added gl_vsync option for disabling vsync
- Added occlusion culling via ARB_occlusion_query

Iceball-MK Revision 5:
- Added client.mk_sys_execv, which makes launchers possible.

Iceball-MK Revision 4:
- De-inlined two functions to work around a bug in clang.

Iceball-MK Revision 3:
- Allowed setting the app title.
- Rebranded to just "The Hole" (from "Fire In The Hole").
- Actually bumped the version number up this time.

Iceball-MK Revision 2:
- Added proper support for 1.x maps.
  - Please don't use the official 1.x maps. They are copyrighted by Jagex and I don't think they'd appreciate it if you used them here.

Iceball-MK Revision 1:
- Disabled world wrap.
- Removed the software renderer. It sucked and did not fulfil its intended purpose.
  - By the way, I disabled the world wrap in the software renderer. But then I removed that renderer.
- Moved the default launch directory to pkg/sparkle/launch/.
- Made it compile properly with clang. Oh, and some of the makefiles are better.
