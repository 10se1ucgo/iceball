First things first, if you have a Windows build, double-click on iceball.exe.

Things to check if it fails:

*** Is this file in the same folder as iceball.exe? ***
If so, you extraced the .zip wrong.
You *MUST* retain the correct directory structure.

*** Have you tried running it in the command line? ***
Open opencmd.bat, and run it from there.
See if you get any errors.
You don't need to worry about stdout.txt/stderr.txt with the official builds,
however if you built it yourself, you may need to check those files.

*** Does opencmd.bat not work for you? ***
Um, you will need access to a commandline *somehow*.

*** I typed in the iceball-gl -c thing and it doesn't work! ***
Did you hit enter?

If so, and you get an error,
take a screenshot or a copy of the EXACT text in your command prompt,
and we can extend this section.

*** Does it *actually* crash? ***
Give us a screenshot of the commandline window showing how it crashed.

The best idea?
Run it in a debugger such as GDB (available with MinGW32).

If you're using GDB, run it like do this:
	handle SIGPIPE nostop noprint pass
	run
and then when it crashes, type:
	bt full

Note, if you get a SIGPIPE/Broken pipe "crash",
you didn't set up the debugger correctly.
I *think* this might be a non-Windows issue though.

In my case I tend to prepend the commandline with "gdb --args ".

Someone else can elaborate here if necessary.

*** How do I change my name? ***
Did you read the built-in tutorial? It mentioned a file. What was it called?

*** Anything else? ***
Join us on IRC: #iceball @ irc.quacknet.org (NOT quaKEnet!).
This really should be on a wiki somewhere.
